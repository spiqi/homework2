    "# Working with Data Lab 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The lab is designed to be self-guided, providing solutions for each exercise to check your work and assist if you get stuck. However, it is important to first attempt to solve the problem on your own as this is the best way to learn. If you become stuck, don't give up and seek help from the instructor, peers, or even a search engine like Google. Be mindful that not all answers from a search engine may be correct, so use your judgement to determine the validity of the information. Remember, the best way to learn is to try solving the problem yourself first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "This lab will introduce you to the basics of working with data in Python. You will learn:\n",
    "- how to secure your Database and API keys and secrets using environment variables\n",
    "- how to read data from a hosted SQL Database\n",
    "- how to read data from a an API\n",
    "- how to read data from a MongoDB database\n",
    "- how to perform web scraping to extract data from a website\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "* üö® These may take a few minutes so get started with this as you settle in.\n",
    "  * Request an API Key from the Census Bureau.You can do this by going to the following link: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html\n",
    "  * Create an account on RapidAPI. You can do this by going to the following link: https://rapidapi.com/\n",
    "* Install this lab's dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pipenv install\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Make sure you switch to the correct environment by choosing the correct kernel in the top right corner of the notebook.\n",
    "  * Note: the name for this lab is very similar to the previous lab, so make sure you select the correct one."
