# Working with Data - Lab 2

## üîç Overview
The lab is designed to be self-guided, providing solutions for each exercise to check your work and assist if you get stuck. However, it is important to first attempt to solve the problem on your own as this is the best way to learn. If you become stuck, don't give up and seek help from the instructor, peers, or even a search engine like Google. Be mindful that not all answers from a search engine may be correct, so use your judgement to determine the validity of the information. Remember, the best way to learn is to try solving the problem yourself first.

## üéØ Objectives
This lab will introduce you to the basics of working with data in Python. You will learn:
- how to secure your Database and API keys and secrets using environment variables
- how to read data from a hosted SQL Database
- how to read data from a MongoDB database
- how to perform web scraping to extract data from a website
